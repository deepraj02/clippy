# Clippy

(I was bored of sending copied text and images over whatsapp to be able to use them in another device, which made me think of clippy)

Clippy is a tool that lets you connect clipboards of multiple devices through a single sign-in. Every device signed in with the same account will be able to access the clipboard of others.
